# WME Wide-Angle Lens

This is script and plugins scans a defined area such as your managed area or even an entire state for issues and have associated plugins generate reports. The main script and its plugins can be found [on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts?set=23559); if installed from this GitHub repo, they will automatically update from GreasyFork. If you want to download all the latest files and import them into TamperMonkey at once, visit the [latest release](https://github.com/WazeDev/WME_Wide-Angle_Lens/releases/latest) to download a zip file.

* Draw an area place of any size but do not save it. The category of the place doesn't matter.
* Click the Wide-Angle Lens tab in the user info pane, click the Areas tab, give the area a name and add it to your area list.
* Click over to the Scan tab, pick the plugins you want to use, select the area to scan and watch as the map is panned through the area
* Don't touch anything while the scan is in progress
* Output will be generated based on the plugins you chose and the filter criteria specified on their associated tab

Words of caution:

* Don't create an area place that is too large. If the plugin you are using is scanning for streets and/or places, the zoom level required is such that scanning a large area may take a long time. You may be better off creating smaller areas.
* This has not been fully tested but I welcome any feedback
